# gravid

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme - gravid!

Being talented just like being gravid, must be known with a long time past. I think I need more time to be talented, so I choose an easy one and named 'gravid'. 😊

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "gravid"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: gravid
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gravid

## Development

Gravid has been scaffolded by the `jekyll new-theme` command and therefore has all the necessary files and directories to have a new Jekyll site up and running with zero-configuration.

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
